This repo serves as a documentation of key concepts I learned while following The Net Ninja's `Node.js Crash Course Tutorial` on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb3Qk8SG5Ms&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jsz4LDYc6kv3ymONOKxwBU)
## Modules & File System

Basics of Node

* Run code using Node on our computer using `node filename`
* Global object and different methods and properties available
* Node module system to import and export things to and from different files
* `File System` core module
* Create streams for reading and writing large amounts of data

## Creating Server

* Require `http` module
* Look at `request` object
* Look at `response` object
* Return `HTML` pages
* Basic routing
* Status Codes
* Redirects

## Express

* Express: A framework that helps to easily manage our routing, requests, server-side logic, and responses in a much more elegant way and makes our code easier to read and update and extend. `npm install express`
* Create an express app
* Routing & `HTML` pages
* Redirects & 404 pages


### PS
* `npm init` to generate a `package.json` file
* `npm install express`
* `npm install -g nodemon` to install `Nodemon` for auto-loading the server on every live changes made on the files
